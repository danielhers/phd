Dear reviewers,

Thank you for your thorough evaluation of my Ph.D. thesis.
I read each of your reviews carefully and I sincerely appreciate your effort.

I made the following revisions, elaborating on and explaining the
background, methods and implications of this work, within the required length limit:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction: added overview of related meaning representation and the broader
tradition of natural language understanding, motivated the stated research questions,
and provided a detailed exposition of UCCA, including various examples.
\item Methodology: literature review of transition-based methods in natural language
processing, demonstration of a TUPA transition sequence and modeling details,
and formalization of neural network techniques used within this work,
as well as explanation and references on the necessity of a compositional inductive bias.
\item Discussion \& Conclusion: addressed the research questions posed in the Introduction
chapter in the perspective of the research contributions,
as well as the prospective future work mentioned in each of the included papers,
including ongoing work and implications.
\end{enumerate}

I believe the changes I made based on your comments resulted in a better thesis,
and I hope it is of high enough quality to be accepted.

Sincerely,

Daniel Hershcovich
