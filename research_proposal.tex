\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Linguistic Annotation}

Semantic tasks in natural language processing, such as machine translation and
sentiment analysis, require understanding the meaning of text. Since text is
merely a sequence of words, it has to be represented in a way that will convey
its meaning. One simple approach, known as the bag-of-words model, looks only
at which words occur in the text. This can already provide
substantial information about the meaning, but it ignores the order of words,
which clearly conveys important information as well. The n-gram model counts
sequences of words with regard to their order, incorporating at least some of
the meaning encoded in the text structure. These models and variations of them
are quite successfully applied to a variety of
tasks\cite{mikolov2013efficient}. Nevertheless, an undeniable part in the
meaning of language resides in its hierarchical structure. Syntax is a way to
model this structure formally. Using syntactic features can improve the
performance in semantic tasks\cite{vandeghinste2013parse}.

However, syntactic annotations suffer from limitations, since they do not
represent the semantic structure of text directly. Simple manipulations such as
switching from an active construction to a passive one, which nearly do not
alter the meaning of text, can yield a significantly different syntactic
structure. Moreover, the same syntactic construct can express conceptually
distinct semantic structures\cite{abend2013ucca}.


\subsection{Semantic Parsing}

Semantic annotation schemes attempt to represent the meaning of natural
language utterances directly. An example is semantic role
labeling\cite{baker1998framenet}\cite{paass2014semantic}, which annotates
predicates and their arguments, classifying them into specific roles. As
opposed to syntactic annotation, which reflects language-specific formal
patterns, semantic annotation corresponds to a higher level of cognitive
processing, and the same framework can potentially apply to any language.
Moreover, a rich semantic annotation scheme may be more beneficial than
syntactic annotation as an input for applications that attempt to solve a
semantic task, due to their tighter relation to the meaning of the text.

While earlier work on semantic parsing has mostly concentrated on shallow semantic analysis,
focusing on semantic role labeling of verbal argument structures,
the focus has recently shifted to parsing of more elaborate representations that account
for a wider range of phenomena. 
Most closely related to my work is Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing (SDP).
%addressed in two SemEval tasks \cite{oepen2014semeval,oepen2015semeval},
%experimenting with the Prague tectogrammatical layer \cite{sgallhp:1986,bohmova2003prague},
%and with dependencies derived from the Enju parser\footnote{See
%\url{http://kmcs.nii.ac.jp/enju/}.}, and Lingo ERG \cite{Flic:02}.
It addresses a wide range of semantic phenomena,
and supports discontinuous units and multiple parents
(see \secref{sec:broad_coverage}).
However, SDP uses
bi-lexical dependencies, disallowing non-terminal nodes, and thus faces difficulties in supporting
structures that have no clear head, such as coordination \cite{Ivanova2012who}.

Semantic parsing methods can be largely partitioned into grammar-based and grammarless methods.
Within the grammar-based literature, most work relied on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG)
\cite{Steedman:00}, which allows computing semantic structure compositionally from the
syntactic derivations. Notable examples include the Boxer parser \cite{bos2005towards}
and the AMR parser by \cite{artzi2015broad}.
Other examples include parsing with Hyperedge Replacement Grammars
\cite{jones2012semantics,chiang2013parsing,peng2015synchronous} and
graph grammars \cite{koller2015semantic}.
A different line of work takes a discriminative, grammarless approach,
pursuing either graph-based methods that predict the highest ranking graph
(tree or DAG) that satisfies a given set of constraints
\cite[for AMR parsing]{flanigan2014discriminative},
or a transition-based method (see \secref{sec:transition_based})
that builds the parse incrementally following a series of local
decisions \cite[and much subsequent work]{Nivre03anefficient}.

Another line of work addresses parsing into Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs)
\cite{flanigan2014discriminative,vanderwende2015amr,pust2015parsing,artzi2015broad}. 
While sharing much of my work's motivation,
AMR does not ground its units in the words and constituents of the text.
This complicates the parsing task, as it requires
that the alignment between words and logical symbols be automatically
(and imprecisely) detected.
\cite{wang2015transition} applied a transition-based approach to AMR parsing,
but their method involved first syntactically parsing the input, and then converting
the resulting tree into an AMR.

\subsection{Broad-Coverage Semantic Representation}\label{sec:broad_coverage}

In order to represent the full range of semantic structures exhibited by
natural language, there are three structural properties that should be supported.
The first is \textbf{multiple parents},
representing arguments and relations (semantic units) that are shared between predicates.
For instance, in the sentence
``After graduation, John moved to Paris'', ``John'' is an argument of both ``graduation''
and ``moved'', yielding a DAG structure (\figref{fig:graduation}), rather than a tree.

The second is \textbf{non-terminal nodes} for representing units
comprising more than one word.
While bi-lexical dependencies partially circumvent this requirement, by
representing complex units in terms of their headwords, they fall short
when representing units that have no clear head.
Frequent examples of such constructions include
coordination structures (e.g., ``\textit{John and Mary} went home''; \figref{fig:home}),
some multi-word expressions (e.g., ``The Haves and the \textit{Have Nots}''),
and prepositional phrases.
In these cases, dependency schemes often apply some annotation convention that
selects one of the sub-units
as the head, but as different head selections are needed for different purposes,
standardization problems arise \cite{Ivanova2012who}.
For example, selecting the preposition to head prepositional phrases yields better
parsing results \cite{Schwartz:12}, while the head noun can be more useful for
information extraction purposes.

Third, semantic units may be \textbf{discontinuous} in the text. For instance, in
``John \textit{gave} everything \textit{up}''
(\figref{fig:gave}), the phrasal verb ``gave ... up'' forms a single semantic unit.
Discontinuities are also pervasive with other multi-word
expressions \cite{schneider2014discriminative}.
Formal representations supporting all three properties are referred to as
{\it Broad-coverage Semantic Structures} (BSS) \cite{hershcovich2016broad}.

However, no existing parser supports the combination of these criteria.
The only semantic annotation scheme that supports them is UCCA (see \secref{sec:ucca}),
which has no existing parser prior to my work.
Several other models either support some of these properties \cite{oepen2015semeval},
or avoid grounding semantic units altogether
(notably, AMR \cite{banarescu2013abstract}).

\paragraph{Notation.}
Let $L$ be the set of possible edge labels.
A BSS is a directed acyclic graph $G=(V,E, \ell)$
over a sequence of tokens $w_1, \ldots, w_n$,
where $\ell:E\to L$ is a function of \textit{edge labels}.
For each token $w_i$ ($i=1, \ldots, n$), there exists a leaf (or a terminal) $t_i \in V$.

\subsection{Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation}\label{sec:ucca}
Universal Cognitive Conceptual Annotation (UCCA)
is a cross-linguistically applicable semantic representation scheme,
that builds on the established ``Basic Linguistic Theory'' framework for typological description
\cite{Dixon:10b,Dixon:10a,Dixon:12}, and on the Cognitive Linguistics literature.
UCCA is a multi-layered representation, where each layer corresponds to a ``module'' of
semantic distinctions (e.g., predicate-argument structures, adverbials, coreference etc.).
%Importantly, the same set of categories can be applied across different lexical items and languages.
%This stands in contrast to more schemes such as FrameNet \cite{Baker:98},
%PropBank \cite{Palmer:05} and AMR, that define an open-ended, lexically-based set of categories,
%which while providing further information, are more prone to coverage issues \cite{Palmer:10},
%and may result in a different set of relations when applied to different languages \cite{Xue2014not}.

Formally, a UCCA structure over a sentence is a DAG, whose leaves correspond to the sentence's words.
The nodes of the graph, or its ``units'', are either terminals or several
sub-units (not necessarily contiguous) jointly viewed as a
single entity according to some semantic or cognitive consideration.
Edges bear a category, indicating the role of the sub-unit in the relation that the parent represents.
UCCA structures support all three criteria of BSS: multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and
discontinuous units.

UCCA's foundational layer covers the predicate-argument
structures evoked by predicates of all grammatical categories
(verbal, nominal, adjectival and others), the inter-relations between them,
as well as other major linguistic phenomena such as coordination and multi-word expressions.
This set of categories has demonstrated applicability to multiple languages, including
English, French, German and Czech, support for rapid annotation, and semantic stability in translation:
UCCA annotations of translated text usually contain the same set of relationships
\cite{sulem2015conceptual}. This finding supports the claim that UCCA represents an abstract
level of semantics, shared by different languages.

The layer's basic notion is the {\it Scene}, which describes a movement, an action or a state.
Each Scene contains one Main Relation, as well as one or more Participants.
For example, the sentence ``After graduation, John moved to Paris'' contains two Scenes,
whose main relations are ``graduation'' and ``moved''. ``John'' is a Participant in both Scenes,
while ``Paris'' only of the latter.
The scheme marks one of the incoming edges for each non-root
as ``primary'' and the others as ``remote'' edges.
The two Scenes in this sentence are both arguments of the \textit{Linker} ``After'',
which in this case expresses a temporal relation between them.
\figref{fig:examples} presents the UCCA annotation of this and other examples.

Further categories account for relations between Scenes and the internal structures of
complex arguments (e.g., coordination) and relations
(e.g., complex adverbials, such a ``very clearly''). UCCA graphs may contain implicit
units that have no correspondent in the text.

\figref{fig:soybeans} shows the UCCA annotation for the sentence
``A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops, such as cotton, soybeans and rice.''.
The sentence was used by \cite{oepen2015semeval} to compare between difference semantic parsing schemes.
It includes a single Scene, whose main relation is ``apply'', a secondary relation ``almost impossible'', as well as two complex arguments: ``a similar technique'' and the coordinated argument ``such as cotton, soybeans, and rice.''
The scene contains an implicit unit, as the agent of ``apply'' has no correspondent in the text.

  }

\end{figure}

Supervised learning of a simplified version of UCCA has already been attempted by
flattening the structure, to get a sequence tagging
problem\cite{beka2013thesis}. An accuracy of $65\%$ was achieved using a
maximum-entropy model. After these initial results, however, the task was
abandoned, firstly because the data set was still small at the time (only a few
thousands of words), and secondly due to the realization that further
conversion from a flat tagging scheme to the full hierarchic one is not
trivial, and could cause subsequent error in the annotation. Therefore, a
direct hierarchic structure prediction may be more reliable. Some attempts were
made by \cite{beka2013thesis} at a partial rule-based heuristic approach, but they proved inefficient.
On the identification of scene-evoking nouns, a subset of a specific type of
relation in UCCA, the performance was not very high either.

\subsection{Distributed Representation}\label{sec:distributed}

Another approach to meaning representation, which has gained popularity recently, is the
representation of words as vectors in a continuous vector space with tens or
hundreds of dimensions\cite{turian2010word}, such that linguistic and semantic
regularities between the words are captured in the
vectors\cite{mikolov2013linguistic}. This kind of representation, called
\textit{word embedding}, can be learned in an unsupervised manner, from large
unlabeled corpora.
Several methods have been developed for generalizing these models to create embeddings
for multi-word phrases, sentences, and even complete documents (see \secref{sec:deep_learning}).
These provides complementary semantic information about the text,
readily used in many machine learning techniques that operate on vectors of numbers.
The more accurately these vectors represent the meaning of the text, the better semantic tasks
can be solved using them.
However, composing these representation so as to maintain the semantic structure remains a challenge.



\section{Goals}\label{sec:goals}

In my research, I will pursue the following goals:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Developing techniques for BSS parsing.
    Specifically, devising a method for automatic prediction of UCCA
    structure given plain text, including at least the foundational layer and possibly more
    refinements when they are defined.
    In particular, the parsing of implicit units, which is likely to require
    the development of specific methods \cite{roth2015inducing}.
  \item Evaluating a new method for distributed representation of phrases
    and sentences, based on compositionality mediated by the UCCA structure,
    and investigating the degree to which it reflects the semantic similarity and relatedness
    between phrases better than the representation composed using syntactic structure.
  \item Using my parser to improve the performance of
    existing techniques for solving semantic tasks, such as sentiment analysis
    and machine translation, which are currently mostly based on syntactic
    parsing or simpler structures for the representation of text
    compositionality.
\end{itemize}


\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Transition-Based Parsing}\label{sec:transition_based}

The transition-based approach has recently produced some of the best
results in syntactic dependency parsing
\cite{dyer2015transition,ballesteros2015improved}, and has also demonstrated
strong performance in a variety of other semantic and syntactic settings
\cite[among others]{maier2015discontinuous,wang2015transition}.
Transition-based methods are a natural starting point for UCCA parsing,
as the set of distinctions it represents, which is centered around predicate-argument
structures and their inter-relations, is similar in spirit to the distinctions
conveyed by dependency schemes.

Transition-based parsing \cite{Nivre03anefficient} creates the parse
as it scans the text from left to right.
The parse is created incrementally by applying a \textit{transition} at each step to the parser state,
defined using three data structures: a buffer $B$ of tokens and nodes to be processed,
a stack $S$ of nodes currently being processed,
and a graph $G=(V,E,\ell)$ of constructed nodes and labeled edges.
Some of the states are marked as \textit{terminal}, meaning that $G$ is the final output.
A classifier is used at each step to select the next transition based on features
that encode the parser's current state.
During training, an oracle creates training instances for the classifier,
based on the gold-standard annotation.

Despite being based on local decisions, transition-based methods have yielded excellent
results in a variety of parsing tasks.
Within syntactic dependency parsing, transition-based methods
have been successfully applied to corpora in many languages and domains, yielding some
of the best reported results \cite{dyer2015transition,ballesteros2015improved}. 
The approach has also yielded results comparable with the state-of-the-art in
constituency parsing \cite{sagae2005classifier,zhang2009transition,zhu2013fast},
discontinuous constituency parsing \cite{maier2015discontinuous},
as well as dependency DAG structures
\cite{sagae2008shift,tokgoz2015transition}, CCG structures \cite{ambati2015incremental}
and AMR parsing \cite{wang2015transition}.


\subsection{Deep Learning}\label{sec:deep_learning}

\paragraph{Neural Networks}
Deep learning and artificial neural networks have received much attention in
several fields of computer science, including computer vision, speech
recognition and natural language processing, due to their best performance in
various tasks\cite{collobert2011nlp}.
In natural language processing, many of the deep learning methods rely strongly
on distributed representation (see \secref{sec:distributed}).

Neural networks are typically trained by gradient descent, where the gradient for the network parameters
is calculated using backpropagation.

\paragraph{Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).}

Several models have been suggested to learn distributed representations for
phrases, based on the representations for single words.
For example, recurrent neural networks can learn semantically meaningful
continuous vector representations of multi-word phrases and sentences,
typically in the same space as the word embedding, and they have a relatively
simple model that does not depend on pre-annotation of structure:
the network \textit{state} at each time step is a function of the input and
the state at the previous time step:
\[
  h_t=f(x_t,h_{t-1})
\]
Where $f$ could be as simple as matrix multiplication followed by a non-linearity,
or a more complicated function such as LSTM.

The gradients for training an RNN are calculated by a variant of backpropagation
called \textit{backpropagation through time}.

\paragraph{Recursive Neural Networks (RecNNs).}

Recursive neural networks can also learn phrase representations, taking advantage
of a pre-annotated hierarchical representation (typically syntactic trees) for
compositionality \cite{socher2010learning}.

A RecNN has a state at each node of the structure: if $C_i$ denotes the set of children of
node $i$, then
\[
  h_i=g(\{f(c)\;|\;c\in C_i\})
\]
where $g$ is a function that aggregates the different representations, such as
concatenation, addition or $\mathrm{max}$.

A RecNN can also be used for structure prediction, or parsing
\cite{socher2013recursive,dyer2015transition}: as the parse is being created, the model can
be used to calculate the intermediate representation at each of the nodes already constructed,
and to make subsequent parsing decisions based upon it.

The gradients for training a RecNN are calculated by \textit{backpropagation
through structure}, another variant of backpropagation, using a recursive
"folding" architecture that can represent a general tree or a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) structure\cite{goller1996learning}.


\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:setup}

In my first experiment, I applied two methods for UCCA parsing:
one based on conversion to simpler structures and using existing parser,
and the other where I developed a novel transition-based BSS parser.

\paragraph{Data.}\label{sec:data}
The English UCCA-annotated corpora \cite{abend2013universal} is used
as a test case, in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.
The in-domain data is taken from the UCCA Wikipedia corpus (henceforth, \textit{Wiki}),
and the out-of-domain data is taken from the English part of the UCCA
\textit{Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea} English-French parallel corpus
(henceforth, \textit{20K Leagues}).\footnote{Both are available at
\url{http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~oabend/ucca.html}}
\tabref{table:data} presents some statistics for the two corpora, demonstrating that while
the \textit{Wiki} corpus is over ten times larger, the overall statistics are
similar.
Passages of indices up to 655 of the \textit{Wiki} corpus are used as training
set, passages 656--700 as development set, and passages 701--695 as in-domain test set.
While UCCA edges can cross sentence boundaries, the common
practice in semantic parsing is to train parsers on individual sentences,
and so this was done here too.
Inter-relations between sentences are thus discarded (0.18\% of the edges).
Linkage nodes and edges are also discarded, as they often express
inter-sentence relations and are thus mostly redundant when applied at the
sentence level, as well as implicit nodes (see \secref{sec:introduction}).
In the out-of-domain experiments, the same parser
(trained on the \textit{Wiki} corpus) is applied to the entire \textit{20K
Leagues} corpus as test set, without re-tuning any parameters.

\label{table:data}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Evaluation.}
Since there are no standard evaluation measures for BSS, I define
two simple measures for comparing such structures.
Assume $G_p=(V_p,E_p,\ell_p)$ and $G_g=(V_g,E_g,\ell_g)$
are the predicted and gold-standard DAGs over the same
sequence of terminals $W = \{w_1,\ldots,w_n\}$, respectively.
For an edge $e=(u,v)$ in either graph,
where $u$ is the parent and $v$ is the child, define its yield $y(e) \subseteq W$ as the
set of terminals in $W$ that are descendants of $v$.
Define the set of \textit{mutual edges} between $G_p$ and $G_g$:
\[
  M(G_p,G_g) =
  \left\{(e_1,e_2) \in E_p \times E_g \;|\;
  y(e_1) = y(e_2) \wedge \ell_p(e_1)=\ell_g(e_2)\right\}
\]
Labeled precision and recall are defined by dividing $|M(G_p,G_g)|$ by $|E_p|$ and $|E_g|$, respectively.
Two variants of this measure are reported, one where only non-remote edges are considered,
and another where remote edges are considered. The measure collapses to the standard
PARSEVAL constituency evaluation measure if $G_p$ are $G_g$ are trees.
Punctuation marks are excluded from the evaluation, but not from the datasets.

\paragraph{Conversions.}
Since no existing BSS parser exists, I convert BSS to different representations where
existing parsers can be applied in order to obtain a comparison to my technique.
I explore two conversion scenarios: one into (possibly discontinuous) constituency trees,
and one into CoNLL-style dependencies. In the first setting I experiment with \textsc{uparse},
the only transition-based constituency parser able to parse trees with
discontinuous constituents.
In the second setting I use the MaltParser with arc-standard and
arc-eager transition sets \cite{nivre2007maltparser},
and the stack LSTM-based arc-standard parser \cite{dyer2015transition}.
In the MaltParser, I use both SVM and perceptron classifiers, and report
results obtained with the SVM classifier, which are about 1\% F-score higher.
Default settings are used in all cases.
\textsc{uparse} uses beam search by default,
with a beam size of 4, where the other parsers use greedy search.

Upper bounds for the conversion-based methods are computed by applying
the conversion and inverse conversion on the gold standard
graphs and comparing them to the original gold standard.

\paragraph{\textsc{bsp}.}
I present a novel transition-based broad-coverage parser,
Broad-coverage Semantic Parser (\textsc{bsp}), that supports multiple parents,
non-terminal nodes and discontinuous units, based on extending existing
transition-based parsers with new transitions and features.
I train \textsc{bsp} both where remote edges
are included, and when they are excluded from the training data, to allow
more direct comparison with conversion-based methods that can only
predict trees.


\subsection{Results}\label{sec:results}

\tabref{table:results} presents the experimental results, as well as
upper bounds for the conversion-based methods.
\textsc{bsp} obtains comparable F-scores to MaltParser and \textsc{uparse}
in terms of primary edges, but unlike them, is able to predict some
of the remote edges as well. 
Removing remote edges from the training data of \textsc{bsp} does not
change results considerably on the primary edges,
improving them by 0.9\% F-score in the in-domain setting, but reduces
them by the same amount when applied out-of-domain. 
Out-of-domain results are largely comparable with the in-domain
results, demonstrating robustness by \textsc{bsp}
to domain variation.

The LSTM parser obtains the highest primary F-score,
with a considerable margin. Importantly, it obtains 9.1\%
F-score higher than the arc-standard MaltParser, which
differs from it only in its classifier.
This suggests that applying a similar neural network-based approach to
\textsc{bsp} is likely to improve results,
and further underscores the effectiveness of transition-based 
methods for BSS parsing. 

The conversion to constituency format only removes remote edges,
and thus obtains a perfect primary edge score.
The conversion to dependency format loses considerably more information, since
all non-terminal nodes are lost and have to be reconstructed by a
simple rule-based inverse conversion. Both conversions yield zero scores on remote edges,
since these are invariably removed when converting to trees.

\section{Significance}\label{sec:significance}

UCCA may have a substantial impact on various semantic NLP tasks. For example,
for machine translation, many approaches currently rely on syntactic parsing as
a component, assuming that syntactic structures in one languages tend to be
translated to the same structures in another language. However, UCCA is more
stable than syntactic annotation cross-linguistically, when looking at
translated sentences\cite{sulem2014thesis}. Indeed, UCCA directly represents
the meaning of the text, which is invariant to translation (by the definition
of the translation task), whereas syntax is only a proxy that varies between
languages.

Recent work in neural networks-based machine translation provide some sort of
an intermediate encoding in the form of distributed representation that can be
encoded from the source language and then decoded into the target
language\cite{zou2013bilingual}, or using memory and treating the text as a
sequence to be converted to another sequence\cite{sutskever2014sequence}.
However, the encoding is based just on averaging across words in the source
sentence, on a flat sequence representation, or at best on a syntactic
representation. A semantic representation like a UCCA graph would perhaps be a
better candidate for the structure by which the encoding and decoding is
performed.

Perhaps just as critical as the successful prediction of UCCA structure, if not
even more critical for the NLP community, is the distributed representation
created when forming phrases using this structure. Current methods in NLP form
multi-word representation based on averaging across words or on syntax, which
may be sub-optimal in representing the true meaning of text. Using a more
semantically faithful way to compose words, such as UCCA, may be a key factor
in enabling computers to understand natural language.



\section{Challenges}\label{sec:challenges}

\subsection{Dataset size}

Models with a large number of parameters typically require training on very
large datasets, and the number of parameters in a deep learning model usually
scales linearly with the number of layers and quadratically with the size of
the representation, along with other factors that may require more parameters.
Since the UCCA dataset is small in relation to other datasets (such as the Penn
Treebank), training deep learning models on it may pose a challenge.
However, as the experimental results show, the neural network-based LSTM parser
already reaches very high scores on the UCCA task.
Furthermore, the dataset can be enlarged and extended to more languages by further
labeling efforts.


\subsection{Scheme coarseness}

The UCCA framework was developed with the foundational layer first, including
relation types that are mainly relevant for syntax. This layer gives only a
coarse annotation: for examples, it labels processes or states and their
participants, but not the role of each participant. The intention is to
gradually refine the annotation to include more fine-grained relation types,
starting with the simplest distinctions. It is possible that learning
the foundational layer alone is easier than learning a more
refined annotation, which would require deeper semantic understanding.
This remains to be investigated when refinements are introduced.

The coarseness of the foundational layer may mean it is not
sufficiently informative for assisting in semantic tasks, because they may
depend on more refined distinctions. However, for many tasks it should be
enough already, as the semantic distinctions that are apparent in syntax are
already covered in the scheme.


\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future}

I intend to further explore conversion-based parsing approaches,
including different target representations and more sophisticated conversion procedures \cite{kong-15},
to shed light on the commonalities and differences between representations, suggesting ways to
design better semantic representations.
I believe that UCCA's merits in providing a cross-linguistically applicable, broad-coverage
annotation will support ongoing efforts to incorporate deeper semantic structures
into a variety of applications, such as machine translation \cite{jones2012semantics}
and summarization \cite{liu2015toward}.

\paragraph{Improving the conversion procedure.}
Several decision have to be made in the conversion between dependency and
constituency annotation.
In the conversion from constituency to dependency, a head terminal has to be
selected for each node. When converting in the other direction, labels for the
added edges have to be determined.
Currently, I handle these decisions by crude heuristics, but a more
sophisticated way can be devised. These will be reflected by higher upper bounds.

\paragraph{Improving the direct parser.}
\textsc{bsp} reaches promising results, but it is very basic in terms of the
techniques used in it. Using beam search rather than greedy inference tends to
improve the parsing scores significantly.
In terms of machine learning, I use a linear classifier with hand-crafted
features. As the experiment with the LSTM parser shows, implementing a parser
based on neural networks should also give a significant improvement to
parsing scores.

\paragraph{Applying the parser to semantic tasks.}
In order to evaluate the contribution of UCCA and \textsc{bsp} to semantic tasks,
I intend to perform experiments using it to calculate distributed representations for
phrases and sentences, and to derive various features whose impact can be assessed quantitatively.
